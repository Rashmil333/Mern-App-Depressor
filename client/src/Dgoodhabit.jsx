							<li> Start a compliments file. Document the great things people say about you to read later.</li>
							<li>  Scratch off a lurker on your to-do list, something that’s been there for ages and you’ll never do.</li>
							<li> Change up the way you make decisions. Decide something with your heart if you usually use your head. Or if you tend to go with your heart, decide with your head.</li>
							<li> Go cloud-watching. Lie on your back, relax, and watch the sky.</li>
							<li> Goof around for a bit. Schedule in five minutes of “play” (non-directed activity) several times throughout your day.</li>
							<li> Get out of your comfort zone, even if it’s just talking to a stranger at the bus stop.</li>
							<li> Get out of your comfort zone, even if it’s just talking to a stranger at the bus stop.</li>

                          <ul>
							<li> Give your body ten minutes of mindful attention. Use the body scan technique to check in with each part of your body.</li>
							<li> Oxygenate by taking three deep breaths. Breathe into your abdomen, and let the air puff out your stomach and chest.</li>
							<li> Take a quick nap. Ten to twenty minutes can reduce your sleep debt and leave you ready for action.</li>

                          <ul >
							<li>  Imagine you’re your best friend. If you were, what would you tell yourself right now? Look in the mirror and say it.</li>
							<li>  Help someone. Carry a bag, open a door, or pick up an extra carton of milk for a neighbor.</li>
							<li> Check in with your emotions. Sit quietly and just name without judgment what you’re feeling.</li>
